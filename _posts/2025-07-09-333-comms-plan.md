## 3-3-3 communications plan
 - Easy to remember (turn on the radio every 3 hours, for 3 minutes, on channel 3)
 - Widely adopted by many neighborhoods, emergency comms groups, survivalists, and disaster preparedness groups.
 - Fully compatible with the other major comms plan (known as the 1-2-3 plan)

 - Can use repeaters
 - Compatible with FRS

## VHF/UHF/HF (ham radio)
 Pros:
  - most flexible
  - most power
  - most capable
  - longest range (depending on band)

Cons:
 - expensive
 - licensing is required to transmit. ($70 for 10 years, only covers the individual, testing required, 3 "levels" of licensing, each with more privileges)
 - All frequencies must be manually programmed - most complex solution to use
 - Not legally compatible with FRS or GMRS (although it is *technically* compatible in life threatening scenarios)

## Weather radio / NOAA alerts
Suggestions:
 - Always on, for effective alerts. Alerts don't help if the device is off.
 - At least 2 power options, AC and battery minimum. Other models can be charged from solar or hand crank.
 - S.A.M.E compatibility - allows restricting alerts to specific types and/or counties
