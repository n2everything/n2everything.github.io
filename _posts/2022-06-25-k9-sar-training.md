Just some K9 training with the local [Peace River Search and Rescue](https://www.prsar.org) team.

Teams are flown in via helicopter, navigate to search area, search their grid and locate targets, then navigate back to landing zone to be picked up by helicopter.

Some members from the local [Peace River Jeepers and 4x4](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1087930271275221_) club were invited to assist in transport and first aid.
